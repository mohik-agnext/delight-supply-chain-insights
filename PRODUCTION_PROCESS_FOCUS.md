# Production Process Focus Document

## Overview
This document outlines our exclusive focus on the Production Process section of the biscuit manufacturing dashboard. As requested, we will ignore the following sections:
- Vendor Performance
- Raw Material Quality
- Finished Product
- Dispute Resolution
- Compliance & Audit

## Current Production Process Structure
The Production Process page is organized into several key components:

1. **Main Dashboard Overview**:
   - Production Health Index gauge
   - Key metrics (Flour Moisture, Dough Temperature, Oven Temperature, Production Yield)

2. **Tab Navigation**:
   - Overview tab: Shows health indices by category and key performance metrics
   - Raw Materials tab: Parameters and trends for raw materials
   - Dough Preparation tab: Parameters and trends for dough preparation
   - Baking tab: Parameters and trends for baking process
   - Operational tab: Operational metrics and parameters

3. **Batch Detail View**:
   - When a specific date is selected, the view changes to show batch-specific details
   - Batches are organized by shift (morning, afternoon, night)
   - Outlier detection highlights problematic batches with orange coloring

4. **Data Filtering**:
   - Filter by vendor
   - Filter by time period
   - Filter by batch shift
   - Drill down to specific dates

## Data Structure
The data is organized into several categories:
- Raw material parameters (flour moisture, gluten strength, etc.)
- Dough preparation parameters (temperature, consistency, etc.)
- Baking parameters (oven temperature, baking time, etc.)
- Operational parameters (cycle time, yield, etc.)

Each parameter has:
- Current value
- Min/max range
- Status (in-range or out-of-range)
- Historical trends (monthly, weekly, batch-level)

## Focus Areas for Enhancement
1. **Data Visualization Improvements**
2. **Performance Optimization**
3. **Batch Detail Analysis Enhancement**
4. **Parameter Correlation Analysis**
5. **Outlier Detection Refinement**
6. **User Experience Improvements**

## Next Steps
We'll proceed with any changes or enhancements to the Production Process page based on specific requirements, while maintaining the existing functionality and improving where needed.
